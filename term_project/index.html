            <p>Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate</p>
            <p>This is a great trip for a family. You can have a day of fun on the river. There are two different route
                options, determined by skill level. We provide life vests, helmets, the raft, oars, and lunch! There are
                quiet parts of the river where you can jump out and swim for a little, but also some fun rapids to takle
                as a group. We ask that childeren are over the age of 10.

            <h3>Weekend Trip<br>(3 days, 2 nights)</h3>
            <p>Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced</p>
            <p>For this trip, we recommend having been on a few whitewater trips in the past. There are rapids on this
                trip
                and some area that can be a little rough. This makes for an exciting trip! Our guides will be there with
                you
                every step of the way. We provide life vests, helmets, the raft, oars, lunches, dinners, and
                breakfast(for
                two days).

            <h3>Week Long Trip<br>(6 days, 5 nights)</h3>
            <p>Skill Level: Advanced to Expert</p>
            <p>This trip is for the thrill seekers with some experience. The whitewater is rougher than our other trips
                we offer. The experience is amazing! Camping under the stars at night and exhilarating rapids during the
                day. We usually have two guides go on these trips with two rafts. This helps with the gear needed. It is
                a wonderful trip that you will not forget.
